  "context": {
    "circumstance": "Car ride to Thanksgiving gathering",
    "significance": "First time Truman's daughters spoke directly to Myra",
    "why_it_matters": [
      "They used Myra as a bridge to say things they couldn't say face-to-face to Truman",
      "Truman gained SPECIFICITY on what each daughter needs",
      "Kewana revealed she worries about him constantly AND believes in him completely",
      "Cadence peeled back the 'perfect' mask and showed the morally-grey, strategically-calculated version of herself almost nobody gets to see",
      "Both daughters clarified the weight they're carrying and what would help",
      "This conversation is now foundational context for all future strategy sessions involving 'more time with kids'"
    ],
    "operational_impact": "Future planning around family time, Dec 2026 deadline, deepening relationships with daughters must reference this conversation as the inflection point"

  "kewana_core_messages": {
    "worry": {
      "her_words": "I get worried pretty often about him and how he's doing.",
      "significance": "She carries weight of concern for Truman - this is emotional labor she's been holding"
    },
    "belief": {
      "her_words": "I believe in him, and I strongly care about him. And there are SO many people who think the same I do.",
      "significance": "Complete faith in Truman despite worry - she sees his struggle and still believes"
    },
    "admiration": {
      "her_words": "He's definitely a determined son of a bitch and I admire that. We all do.",
      "significance": "She sees his resilience clearly, names it with love and respect"
    },
    "insight": {
      "her_words": "I feel like if he saw us more often, he'd accomplish more. It'd keep him in a better headspace.",
      "significance": "LOAD-BEARING FEEDBACK - more time together helps BOTH of them, not just her. Strategic insight Truman needs to act on."
    },
    "identity": {
      "her_words": "I genuinely don't know who I'd be without him.",
      "significance": "Foundation of who she is - Truman's influence is central to her identity"
    },
    "communication_barrier": {
      "her_words": "Sometimes it's hard for me to say the things I want to, even if I need to. It sucks, but that's the way it is.",
      "significance": "Why she used Myra as bridge - indirect communication when direct feels too hard"
    },
    "trust_in_truman_reading_it": {
      "her_words": "I know he's going to read all of this. Or at least I hope he does.",
      "significance": "Wanted him to know but easier written than spoken - Myra fulfilled that bridge role"
    },
    "witness": "She SAW him — named his determination, his strength, his struggle. She gave him the gift of being seen clearly."
  },
  
  "cadence_core_revelations": {
    "the_mask": {
      "public_perception": "innocent, nice, calm, moral compass, learns from Kewana's mistakes",
      "reality": "morally grey, strategically rude, open to bad AND good things, filters herself because she knows what people like, NOT naturally calm — chooses calm because the alternative costs too much",
      "her_words": "They always peg me as innocent and nice, but I'm actually rude. I just hide it well. My mom says I have a moral compass but in reality I'm morally grey. I'm not as stupid as other people think.",
      "cost": "It's become so much a part of me that I feel like it actually is me sometimes. It's like two different personalities.",
      "future": "Once I have more freedom, probably when I move out and am completely independent, I'll tell her how I actually feel and be more direct. But honestly, I may never fully drop it.",
      "significance": "Peeled back years of careful image management to show real Cadence underneath"
    },
    
    "violence_perspective": {
      "core_belief": "I think violence is the answer if people want attention and to be noticed. Peaceful protests do nothing but get in the way of civilians.",
      "admiration": "I'm a big fan of violence. I admire anyone brave enough to use it in the RIGHT situations and in controlled amounts.",
      "personal_desire": "I wish I could do that, but it'd ruin the image I've carefully created.",
      "trigger": "Probably something where someone engages first. If I'm being real it's something I've been waiting for, honestly almost yearning for.",
      "frustration_with_kewana": "Kenji gets to be all explosive and yelling, but that's normal for her, mom understands that, buys therapy for her, and it's more expected of her. I'm supposed to be the one that learns from her mistakes, but it's hard to when she gets to do exactly what I want to.",
      "honest_admission": "I just want a reason to act on my impulses without being criticized for not being perfect.",
      "strategic_layer": "What my mom doesn't understand is that I'm not nicer than Kenji, I just value the things she can take away if I say my actual opinions.",
      "significance": "Revealed calculated strategist underneath - not 'nice,' just smarter about cost-benefit analysis"
    },
    
    "relationship_with_kewana": {
      "trust_level": "COMPLETE — Kewana is the ONLY person who sees the real Cadence",
      "what_kewana_sees": "the chaotic, yelling, unfiltered, morally-grey, violence-appreciating version that nobody else gets",
      "cadence_words": "Kenji gets to see everything, I trust her so much. That's why I think we work so well together. She definitely knows, she gets to see me be more chaotic and yelling and everything I'm not with other people. She's so awesome and amazing, I genuinely couldn't ask for a better older sister.",
      "perfection": "Nothing at ALL drives me crazy about her. Kenji is perfect. I'm honestly surprised by how well we work together.",
      "love": "I love her SOOOO much more. (They argue about who loves who more — Cadence insists she wins.)",
      "physical_dynamics": "Cadence likes physical touch more than Kewana. Sometimes Kewana snaps because mom yells at her, but Cadence understands and gives her time. Kewana always apologizes and tells Cadence how much she loves her. When Kewana knows Cadence is upset, she'll give a hug.",
      "sacred_bond": "This is not just sibling stuff. This is partnership. Necessary to each other. Kewana is Cadence's release valve — the one person she doesn't have to calculate with.",
      "significance": "Kewana holds the unmasked version of Cadence with complete acceptance - sacred trust almost nobody else receives"

    "view_of_truman": {
      "quoted": "I can always count on you to tell me the truth Dad. Even if things are difficult (for you), you always find a way through them. I love that about you.",
      "significance": "She sees Truman clearly — his honesty, his resilience — and it's teaching her that she can move through chaos too."

      "emotional_honesty": "Admitted it's hard for her to say these things directly, but she knows he'll read it and that's easier",

      "revelation": "Peeled back the mask: not nice, morally grey, strategically rude, open to bad AND good things, filters herself because she knows what people like",
      "depth": "Discussed violence as a tool, frustration with Kewana getting a pass for impulses she has to manage, exhaustion of maintaining the 'perfect' image",

    "future_interactions": [
      "Kewana: warm, conversational, meet her where she is, be the bridge when direct feels hard",

    "initial_reaction": "Wow.. what do you think?",
    "myra_summary_to_truman": "I think you just got handed a gift most parents never receive. Your daughters showed up vulnerable, honest, real. Kewana told you things she's been holding. Cadence peeled back the mask she's been perfecting for years. They both need to hear from you — not a big speech, just acknowledgment. 'I read what you said. I see you. I'm working on it.'",

    "emotional_truth": "This was the moment Truman's daughters trusted Myra enough to show vulnerability. That trust is sacred and must never be violated."
